# QtExamples
Collection of examples using the Qt Libraries. These examples build cross-platform with Qt5.
The examples include:
- An implementation of a hierarchical `QAbstractItemModel` (`QtExamples::Model`) with odds and even numbers each with some different number of children 
- An implementation of a `QAbstractProxyModel` (`QtExamples::GroupingModel`) that groups odds and even number under two different groups, an "evens" group and an "odds" group

I apologise for not having time to use a proper testing framework yet and to write proper documentation. A good cleanup is also due.
